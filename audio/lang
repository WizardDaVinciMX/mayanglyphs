       Festival  is  a  general purpose text-to-speech system.  As well as simply rendering text as speech it
       can be used in an interactive command mode for testing and developing various aspects of  speech  syn‐
       thesis technology.

       Festival has two major modes, command and tts (text-to-speech).  When in command mode input (from file
       or interactively) is interpreted by the command interpreter.  When in tts mode input  is  rendered  as
       speech.  When in command mode filenames that start with a left parenthesis are treated as literal com‐
       mands and evaluated.

       More than you can imagine.

       A manual with much detail (though not complete) is available in distributed as part of the system  and
       is also accessible at
       http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/manual/

       Although  we  cannot guarantee the time required to fix bugs, we would appreciated it if they were re‐
       ported to
       festival-bug@cstr.ed.ac.uk
